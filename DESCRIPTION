Description: Computes a range of scatterplot diagnostics (scagnostics) on pairs
  of numerical variables in a data set. A range of scagnostics, including graph
  and association-based scagnostics described by Leland Wilkinson and Graham
  Wills (2008) <doi:10.1198/106186008X320465> and association-based
  scagnostics described by Katrin Grimm (2016,ISBN:978-3-8439-3092-5) can be 
  computed. Summary and plotting functions are provided.
