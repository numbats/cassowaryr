\title{Compute convex scagnostic measure}
\usage{
sc_convex(x, y, alpha = "rahman", out.rm = TRUE, binner = "hex")
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{numeric vectors}

\item{alpha}{character, numeric, or function. Controls the alpha radius.
Valid character values are:
\itemize{
\item "rahman" (default): Rahman's MST-based middle-50\% alpha
\item "q90": 90th percentile of MST edge lengths
\item "omega": graph-theoretic scagnostics alpha
Alternatively:
\item a numeric value giving a fixed alpha
\item a function with no arguments that returns a single numeric alpha
}}

\item{out.rm}{logical; if TRUE, iteratively trim large MST edges, If FALSE
the scanostics will be computed on the entire data set with no outlier
removal.}

\item{binner}{an optional function that bins the x and y vectors prior
to triangulation
Can be:
\itemize{
\item \code{"hex"} (default): hexagonal binning following the procedure in the
graph-theoretic scagnostics paper (start 40x40, halve
until <= 250 nonempty cells)
\item \code{NULL}: no binning (use raw points)
\item a function: user-defined binner
}}
}
\value{
A numeric object that gives the plot's convex score.
}
\description{
A measure of how convex the shape of the data is. It was first defined in
Graph Theoretic Scagnostics, Wilkinson, et al. (2005).Computed as the ratio
between the area of the alpha hull and convex hull. Unlike the other
scagnostic measures, a high value on convex does not correlate to an
interesting scatter plot, rather it usually indicates a lack of relationship
between the two variables.
