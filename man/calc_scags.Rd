\title{Compute selected scagnostics on subsets}
\usage{
calc_scags(
  x,
  y,
  scags = c("outlying", "stringy", "striated", "grid", "clumpy", "clumpy2", "sparse",
    "skewed", "convex", "skinny", "monotonic", "splines", "dcor"),
  out.rm = TRUE,
  binner = "hex",
  alpha = "rahman"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{numeric vectors}

\item{scags}{collection of strings matching names of
scagnostics to calculate: outlying, stringy, striated,
grid, striped, clumpy, clumpy2, sparse, skewed, convex,
skinny, monotonic, splines, dcor}

\item{out.rm}{logical; if TRUE, iteratively trim large MST edges, If FALSE
the scanostics will be computed on the entire data set with no outlier
removal.}

\item{binner}{an optional function that bins the x and y vectors prior
to triangulation
Can be:
\itemize{
\item \code{"hex"} (default): hexagonal binning following the procedure in the
graph-theoretic scagnostics paper (start 40x40, halve
until <= 250 nonempty cells)
\item \code{NULL}: no binning (use raw points)
\item a function: user-defined binner
}}

\item{alpha}{character, numeric, or function. Controls the alpha radius.
Valid character values are:
\itemize{
\item "rahman" (default): Rahman's MST-based middle-50\% alpha
\item "q90": 90th percentile of MST edge lengths
\item "omega": graph-theoretic scagnostics alpha
Alternatively:
\item a numeric value giving a fixed alpha
\item a function with no arguments that returns a single numeric alpha
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with all selected scagnostic values for a particular x,
y pair.
}
\description{
This function allows you to calculate a large number of scagnostics quickly
and efficiently. While the individual scagnostic calculation functions
(sc_\emph{) are good for looking at a single scagnostic, it is inefficient when
computing more than one scagnostic. This is becasue the sc_} functions
recompute the graph object for each plot and scagnostic pair, even if
the graph objects are unchanged. Additionally, typing the functions over
and over again quickly becomes tedious. For this reason, we have the
calc_scags function that will reuse the same graph
object for all scagnostics.
