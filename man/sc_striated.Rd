\title{Compute striated scagnostic measure using MST}
\usage{
sc_striated(x, y, out.rm = TRUE, binner = "hex")
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{numeric vectors}

\item{out.rm}{logical; if TRUE, iteratively trim large MST edges, If FALSE
the scanostics will be computed on the entire data set with no outlier
removal.}

\item{binner}{an optional function that bins the x and y vectors prior
to triangulation
Can be:
\itemize{
\item \code{"hex"} (default): hexagonal binning following the procedure in the
graph-theoretic scagnostics paper (start 40x40, halve
until <= 250 nonempty cells)
\item \code{NULL}: no binning (use raw points)
\item a function: user-defined binner
}}
}
\value{
A numeric object that gives the plot's striated score.
}
\description{
This measure identifies features such as discreteness by finding parallel
lines. It was first defined in Graph Theoretic Scagnostics, Wilkinson,
et al. (2005). It is calculated by counting the proportion of vertices
with only two edges that have an inner angle approximately between
135 and 220 degrees.
