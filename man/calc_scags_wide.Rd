\title{Compute scagnostics on all possible scatter plots for the given data}
\usage{
calc_scags_wide(
  all_data,
  scags = c("outlying", "stringy", "striated", "grid", "clumpy", "clumpy2", "sparse",
    "skewed", "convex", "skinny", "monotonic", "splines", "dcor"),
  out.rm = TRUE,
  binner = "hex",
  alpha = "rahman"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{all_data}{tibble of wide multivariate data}

\item{scags}{collection of strings matching names of
scagnostics to calculate: outlying, stringy, striated,
grid, striped, clumpy, clumpy2, sparse, skewed, convex,
skinny, monotonic, splines, dcor}

\item{out.rm}{logical; if TRUE, iteratively trim large MST edges, If FALSE
the scanostics will be computed on the entire data set with no outlier
removal.}

\item{binner}{an optional function that bins the x and y vectors prior
to triangulation
Can be:
\itemize{
\item \code{"hex"} (default): hexagonal binning following the procedure in the
graph-theoretic scagnostics paper (start 40x40, halve
until <= 250 nonempty cells)
\item \code{NULL}: no binning (use raw points)
\item a function: user-defined binner
}}

\item{alpha}{character, numeric, or function. Controls the alpha radius.
Valid character values are:
\itemize{
\item "rahman" (default): Rahman's MST-based middle-50\% alpha
\item "q90": 90th percentile of MST edge lengths
\item "omega": graph-theoretic scagnostics alpha
Alternatively:
\item a numeric value giving a fixed alpha
\item a function with no arguments that returns a single numeric alpha
}}
}
\value{
A data frame that gives the scagnostic scores for every possible
pair of variables.
}
\description{
It is quite common to have data in a wide format that is not suitable to
feed into the calc_scags function that would need a long format. To save
users time and energy we also provide a wide version of the calc_scags
function. This function will compute all selected scagnostics for every
pair wise set of variables in the data frame.
